TODO:
- fox kills hare on catch 
- improve world generation
  - create a world grid with cells to keep track of what tiles hold what so that they don't overlap
  - use noise maps to determine terrain layout
    1. use worley noise to determine biomes
        < .5 => snow
            - basic biome
            - small chance to spawn a rock or tree (use perlin noise with high threshold)
        < .75 => rock field
            - higher visibility
            - high chance to spawn a rock (perlin noise with low threshold)
            - low chance to spawn a tree (white noise with high threshold)
        < 1 => forest
            - lower visibility
            - high chance to spawn a tree (white noise )
        - save random number as biome id
    2. for every biome add 0-2 fox dens using the random worley value
  - use perlin noise to create distributed clumps of food

DONE
- Learn how to use butler to deploy to itch
- Improve fox chasing
  - include temporary hare sprinting speed
  - make it run slower
  - turning radius
  - can only run for a short time
